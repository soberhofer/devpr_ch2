# Configuration for the ResNet18 model

name: ResNet18 # This should match the function name in models/resnet.py

params:
  # output_size will be interpolated from the data config (e.g., data.n_classes)
  # This will be passed as num_classes to the ResNet18 function.
  output_size: ${data.n_classes}

  # Number of input channels for the spectrogram (default: 3 in the model code, 1 for our use case)
  # The ResNet18 function in resnet.py takes 'channels' as its second argument
  channels: 1

  # Dropout probability before the final fully connected layer (0.0 means no dropout)
  dropout_prob: 0.0
