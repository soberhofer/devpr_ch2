# Configuration for the ResNet50 model

name: ResNet50 # This should match the function name in models/resnet.py

params:
  # num_classes will be interpolated from the data config (e.g., data.n_classes)
  # The ResNet50 function in resnet.py takes 'num_classes' as its first argument
  num_classes: ${data.n_classes}

  # Number of input channels for the spectrogram (default: 3 in the model code, 1 for our use case)
  # The ResNet50 function in resnet.py takes 'channels' as its second argument
  channels: 1
